# Power BI – Data Cleaning with Power Query

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how I used **Power Query in Power BI** to clean and transform raw foreign direct investment (FDI) data for analysis and dashboard building.

## 📁 Files Included
- `1a- Foreign Direct Investment.xlsx` → Raw data with multiple years as columns, metadata rows, and unstructured format.
- `cleaned data using power query _linkedin.xlsx` → Cleaned and transformed version ready for visualization.

## 🧹 Key Transformations Performed
- Removed metadata and header rows
- Promoted correct row as headers
- Unpivoted year columns into a single "Year" column
- Renamed columns for clarity
- Filtered out blanks and invalid entries
- Changed data types for consistency

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
- Power BI (Power Query Editor)
- Data cleaning & reshaping
- Unpivoting and column management

## 📈 Next Steps
- Use this cleaned dataset to build a Power BI dashboard showing FDI trends by sector, year, and country.
